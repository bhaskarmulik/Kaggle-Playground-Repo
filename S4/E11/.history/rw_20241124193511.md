# Rough work

- There are rows with the same profession as the name. We need to remove these
- Check whether there are enough records to train the model
- Make sure to use redundancy for drop function
- Dealing with missing vals:
  - Create a temp df with no missing values
  - We can then analyse this data to make a simple regression model for the profession corresponding to the missing value
  - We also need to check correlations too
  
#### Thinking of using a embedding model for profession

Here is a step-by-step plan to achieve this:

- Prepare the Data: Convert the 'Profession' column to a categorical type and then to integer codes.
- Create an Embedding Layer: Define an embedding layer in your neural network to learn the embeddings for the 'Profession' feature.
- Train the Neural Network: Train the neural network with the embedding layer included.
